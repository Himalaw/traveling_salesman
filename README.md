# Traveling Salesman Problem

![readme-banner](/Users/walidah/Desktop/GIT/cl03_2/tsp.jpg)

## Abstract:
<p align="justify"> This project focuses on the implementation and comparison of various heuristics to solve the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point. We implemented several heuristics, including greedy methods and local search techniques, and analyzed their performance using different metrics.</p>

## Repository Assets:

- [Heuristic code](CODE/)
- [Benchmark Datasets](DATA/)

## Business Context:
<p align="justify"> In today's globalized world, optimizing logistics and transportation routes is crucial for businesses aiming to enhance their competitiveness and reduce operational costs. Efficient vehicle routing can lead to significant savings in time and money, as well as a reduction in carbon emissions. The TSP is a fundamental problem in logistics optimization, with applications ranging from delivery services to circuit board design.</p>

## Problem Description:
<p align="justify"> The Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves finding the shortest path through a set of points in a plane, where the distance between points is measured using the Euclidean distance. This project implements and compares different heuristic approaches to solve the TSP, including the Nearest Neighbor, Farthest Insertion, 2-opt local search, and Iterated Local Search (ILS) methods. The performance of these heuristics is evaluated based on solution quality and computational efficiency using instances from the TSPLIB library.</p>
